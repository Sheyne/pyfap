swig python bindings for libfap
=======
swig python bindings for libfap

Install with `python setup.py install`


Dependencies
============

This package depends on the [libfap](http://pakettiradio.net/libfap/) library. Install this first. 

If python is installed without the developer tools, these will also need to be installed to link against. On systems with APT, this can be done with

	# aptitude install python-dev

# Issue
generated fap_back.py is not copied
